To report a security issue, email contact@fabco.tech and include the word "SECURITY DAPPY" in the subject line. If it is a bug you may as well connect on [discord](https://discord.gg/8Cu5UFV).
 
A bug bounty platform is planned, it may be on intigriti.com or hackerone. The software is not stable enough yet for us to offer compensation. But definitly in 2021 we'll have a bug bounty program.

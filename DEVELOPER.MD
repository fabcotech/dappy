### Developer guide

This document is about introducing the stack and structure of the project. It is mainly built on javascript technologies and javascript frameworks.

#### Stack and major components

If you don't understand some terms, please refer first to the [glossary](https://dappy.tech/glossary).

**‚ö´ Main process**, 1 process, permanent :
- Entry point: `main/main.ts`, compile (rollup) `npm run build:main`.
- Main electron JS process (Node JS + Typescript).
- Node JS + typescript.
- Includes a redux store, mainly replicated/synced with browser-s process store.
- Handles all multi-requests / blockchain requests, see `main/performMultiRequest.ts` and `main/performSingleRequest.ts`.
- Handles the HTTPS traffic coming from tabs and browser process, see `main/overrideHttpProtocols.ts`.

**üê∂ Browser process**, 1 process, permanent :
- Entry point `src/index.tsx`, compile (parcel) `npm run build`.
- Main browser layout process (React JS + Redux JS + Redux saga + HTML/CSS + Typescript).
- Includes a redux store divided in 7/8 parts (`dapps`, `ui`, `main` etc).

**üåç Tab processes** n processes, 1 per dapp or IP app, ephemeral :
- If dapp, entry point is `src/dapp-sandboxed.ts` compile (parcel) `npm run build:dapp-sandboxed`.
- If IP app, no entry point, website loaded through HTTP + TLS.
- Tab processes/windows are created in `main/store/sagas/loadOrReloadBrowserView.ts`.
- Sandboxed environment with controlled internet access, each tab is identified by a randomId in user agent, see `main/overrideHttpProtocols.ts`.

#### Quick start
```
npm install

# Parcel server on localhost:3033, live reload of css and js
npm run start:parcel

# Electron
npm run start:electron
```

#### Global dependencies

Install global dependencies (sudo)
```
# Add --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root if you have an error

npm install typescript -g
# sentry-cli
curl -sL https://sentry.io/get-cli/ | bash
```

Please join us anytime [https://discord.gg/8Cu5UFV](https://discord.gg/8Cu5UFV) if you have question(s)/issue(s).

#### Sentry

At each releases, js and js.map files must be uploaded, add the following lines to /home/YOURNAME/.sentryclirc :
```
[auth]
token=TOKEN
[defaults]
org=fabco
project=dappy-alpha / dappy-beta etc...
```
#### Translations

The service used for translations is [poeditor.com](https://poeditor.com).

See `./translations/README.MD`.

#### Tags

Dappy browser interact with two kind of entities: a dappy network, or a private/final server. Private/final server is only for IP applications navigation, all other networks requests follow the multi-request paradigm.

![Dappy browser connections](https://dappy.tech/images/dappy_browser_connections.jpg)

Tags have been added to the code so you can quickly find where those connections / requests are made.
- **no dns**: Dappy browser does not use the Domain Name System, and does raw IP requests, check this tag to see where it occurs.
- **browser to server**: See how IP apps and no-DNS navigation is done.
- **browser to network**: See how Dappy browsers queries the Dappy network.
- **browser to node**: In case of a deploy (not a read query), multi-request is inadequat, a single browser to node query is performed.
- **tab process - main process**: Inter-process secure communication between a tab and the main process.
- **browser process - main process**: Inter-process secure communication between the browser process and the main process.

#### Add dappy local js/css libraries

- Add the library in dapp-libs/js or dapp-libs/js
- Add the type in src/models/DappManifest.ts
- Add the corresponding entry in src/RESSOURCES.ts

#### Dev upgrade the version of dappy

This is the process you must respect to upgrade Dappy.

- upgrade version number in `package.json`
- upgrade version number in `src/CONSTANTS`

#### Build for production

```
# On linux (have fpm installed)
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y rpm
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev build-essential
sudo gem install fpm
fpm --version

rm -rf dist/ && git rm -rf dist/

npm run build
npm run build:main
npm run build:dapp-sandboxed

git add main.js dist/*
```

#### Register new release to sentry

Important : do this after you have built and tested on all platforms, the file names for this release should not change.

Each new release must be registered to sentry, and .js and .js.map files uploaded.

Create a ~/.sentryclirc` file with the right values :
```
[auth]
token=TOKEN
[defaults]
org=ORG
project=PROJECT
```


See https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/
```
sentry-cli releases new RELEASE
sentry-cli releases files RELEASE upload-sourcemaps ./dist/ --validate
sentry-cli releases finalize RELEASE
```

#### Packaging / create installers

Check the version in package.json, it will be the app version

On every OS
```
npm i -g electron-builder
```

Package for windows (on windows)
```
# ENV variables, add the two following environment variables to your system
Fill the certificateFile entry in the build.yml file:         C:\Users\joe\path\to\certificate.p12
Fill the certificatePassword entry in the build.yml:          password_for_certificate

# 64 bits
npm run electron-builder:dist:windows:64
# rename the .exe created in output/ or it will be overwritten (by 32 bits)

# 32 bits
npm run electron-builder:dist:windows:32
```

Package for linux (on linux)
```
npm run electron-builder:dist:linux:deb
npm run electron-builder:dist:linux:rpm
```

On mac (on macOS)
```
npm run electron-builder:dist:mac
```

See https://support.comodo.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/1232/7/codesign-digital-signatures-in-mac-os for signing on macOS
